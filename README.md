Sample voice and transcript dataset by Verbatim, Baby!


Whipping raw audio into data and showcasing the ease with which 
Google Gemini breaks when facing a non-dominant language like Afrikaans
that’s polluted by Dutch influences, as well as documenting the experiences of 
         our volunteering Afrikaans participants.

     * ELGemini: A young, native Afrikaans-speaking car parts 
       salesman who uses Gemini with limited success using 
       spoken Afrikaans, and mostly demonstrates how easily it 
       misunderstands, flips languages and accents, spells out
       words, and loses context.

•	Joshua: A young, native English speaker who is learning Afrikaans 
  and practicing his conversational skills with Google Gemini. Often,
  his conversations are unsatisfactory for him as Gemini misunderstands him,
  switches accents and languages, and uses mainly 
  academic Afrikaans or Dutch.

•	Lindie: A middle-aged woman from a small town who volunteered for this project 
  to tell of how she accidentally became a tik addict, and how she pulled herself out 
  after 12 years. She speaks candidly about those years of her life, and sometimes her 
  current boyfriend also speaks. This is a more specialized set due to confidentiality and 
  incriminating matters discussed, and is accompanied by an NDA.

•	Megan: An occupational therapist who lives in the Western Cape. She is a relative 
  of the project leader and speaks casually and with familiarity. Megan volunteered 
  her voice notes because she often tries to speak to Gemini in Afrikaans, but struggles
  to understand its responses due to language and accent flipping and the massive amount 
  of mispronounced and spelled-out words. She confesses to hating the Google Internet 
  speaker in her mother’s kitchen because it only understands English.
